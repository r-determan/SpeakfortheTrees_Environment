This Shapefile contains smoothed demographic data based on the 2020 Census Tracts.
Note: Some census tracts have zero to a small number of residents. Due these outliers causing issues, 12 census tracts were removed.

GEOID20 -> GEOID for 2020 census tract
TotalPp -> Total Population within tract
MinrPrc -> Percent of population that is a minority race
PpDnsty -> Population Density (Land area only)
MedGrTx -> Median Gross Parcel Tax 
Mdn_Inc -> Median Income

MnrPrc_t -> Minority Percentage transformed on the logit scale
MnrPrc_s -> Smoothed Minority Percentage
MnrPrc_r -> Residuals for smoothed Minority Percentage (MnrPrc_t - MnrPrc_s)

MdGrTx_t -> Median Gross Parcel Tax transformed on log( +1) scale
MdGrTx_s -> Smoothed Median Gross Parcel Tax 
MdGrTx_r -> Residuals for smoothed Median Gross Parcel Tax (MdGrTx_t - MdGrTx_s)

Mdn_Inc_t -> Median Income transformed on log( +1) scale
Mdn_Inc_s -> Smoothed Median Income
Mdn_Inc_r -> Residuals for smoothed Median Income (Mdn_Inc_t - Mdn_Inc_s)
Note: Variogram for Median Income was not fully stationary for farther distances, so smoothed results will have some error
